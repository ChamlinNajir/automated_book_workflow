"The Gates of Morning"
CHAPTER I
THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze drifting southward. Behind him, the outer sea's thunderous breakers crashed against the shore, sending spindrift scattering on the wind. Before him, the calm lagoon of Karolin stretched out, its infinite blue expanse dotted with fishing gulls. The tribe, women, children, and youths, bustled about the beach in the scorching sun, engaged in fishing, playing, or tending to their paraka patches.

He had claimed this place, this sea within a sea, just yesterday. The canoes drawn up on the sand, the empty houses where war canoes once rested on their rollers – all of it was his. Then, his eyes turned from the lagoon to the northern sea, and his brow furrowed. Beyond the sea line, invisible to the naked eye, lay Palm Tree, an island of beauty and devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi, the net maker, perched on the coral beside him, gazed up at him with curiosity. Tari knew little of life, but he sensed that all the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women and children undefended. Yesterday, this stranger, sent by the gods, according to the women, had arrived, bearing the name Dick Lestrange. The child's eyes sparkled with innocence as he asked the question that had been burning in his mind: "Taori, who are you?"

If Dick had spoken in his native tongue, the child might not have understood the story of his past. Who was Dick before he became Taori? What lay beyond the world he knew? Tari's facile mind shifted gears, drawn to the cries of children hauling in a net, and he rose to join them. Dick's gaze returned to the north, his thoughts stirring with memories of the schooner that had anchored at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesian crew. He saw Katafa, the girl blown away by a storm years ago, and himself, making their escape in the old dinghy.

As he gazed northward, the memory of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree stained the beauty of the sea and sky. He was no longer a boy, but a man who could think forward, imagine, and conjure possibilities. The white man, risen to the surface of his consciousness, shared a past with Katafa, a bond that tied him to her like the threads of their shared history.

Katafa's hand touched his shoulder, and he turned to find her eyes fixed on the northern sea line, her dark hair blowing back like an eagle's feather in the breeze. "Look!" she whispered, as Palm Tree, their former home, began to materialize on the horizon. The island, once a refuge, now loomed as a threat, its beauty tempered by the horrors they had escaped.

As they stood there, unspeaking, their minds untutored by the concept of mirage, they saw the island once more – the figures of the Melanesians on the beach, the wind in the sail, the cries of the savages, and the smoke of the burnt schooner. The scene unfolded before them, a loveliness tinged with menace.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes growing dark with hatred. They had threatened him, but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa, his other self, his love. Some day, they would come, drawn by the lure of the lagoon's mirror-like surface. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come, driven by instinct, driven by desire.

And so, the vision of Palm Tree vanished, leaving Dick to ponder the dangers that lay beyond the horizon, beyond the world of water that ringed the two islands, beyond the realm of savages and civilization.
