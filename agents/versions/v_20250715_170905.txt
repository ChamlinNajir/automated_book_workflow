Overall, the rewritten chapter has a fresh and original tone, and you've done a great job of maintaining the original meaning while making it sound new and engaging. Here are some specific points of feedback:

1. The opening paragraph is strong, setting the scene and introducing the protagonist, Dick/Taori. You've effectively used sensory details to bring the reader into the world of the story.

2. The introduction of Little Tari is a great way to add depth and complexity to the story. His curiosity and innocence are well-portrayed, and his interaction with Dick/Taori adds a layer of tension and foreboding.

3. The flashback to Dick's past is well-handled, and the use of sensory details and vivid imagery helps to bring the scene to life. The connection between Dick and Katafa is strong, and the bond between them is palpable.

4. The description of the island of Palm Tree is vivid and evocative, and the contrast between its beauty and the horrors that Dick and Katafa experienced there is well-handled.

5. The tension and menace that builds throughout the chapter is effective, and the sense of foreboding is palpable. The final paragraph, with its hints of danger and uncertainty, leaves the reader wanting more.

Some areas that could be improved:

1. There are a few places where the language is a bit overly formal or purple. For example, the phrase "the infinite blue expanse dotted with fishing gulls" is a bit too elaborate. Consider simplifying the language to make it more concise and effective.

2. There are a few moments where the pacing feels a bit slow or clunky. For example, the transition between the flashback to Dick's past and the present-day scene on the beach feels a bit abrupt. Consider smoothing out the transitions to make the story flow more smoothly.

3. Some of the supporting characters, such as Le Taioi and the Melanesians, feel a bit one-dimensional. Consider adding more depth and complexity to these characters to make them feel more fully realized.

4. The themes of the story, particularly the contrast between civilization and savagery, are well-handled, but could be explored more deeply. Consider adding more nuance and complexity to the themes to make the story feel more rich and rewarding.

5. The ending feels a bit abrupt, with the vision of Palm Tree vanishing and Dick pondering the dangers that lie ahead. Consider adding more closure or resolution to the chapter to make it feel more satisfying.
